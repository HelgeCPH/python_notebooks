    "  * You will learn how to write internal DSLs in Java and Groovy!\n",
    "  * That is, you will learn Groovy (http://groovy-lang.org), a powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with static-typing and static compilation capabilities, for the JVM.\n",
    "  * You will learn how to write external DSLs in Xtext \n",
    "  * You will learn how to write code generators and additional IDE tooling with Xtend (http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/), a flexible and expressive dialect of Java, which compiles into readable Java 5 compatible source code.\n",
    "  * You will learn how to write code refactorings in TXL.\n",

    "## What will we talk about & apply?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Why do we need DSLs at all and why do they matter?\n",
    "  * Internal vs. external DSLs.\n",
    "  * IDE tooling for your own language, including validation, syntax highlighting, etc.\n",
    "  * Code generation, let the computer do the laborious tasks.\n",
    "  * Raise abstraction, allow non-programmers to code.\n",
    "  * Having fun with abstract and meta-concepts.\n",
